How to run Steps:

You can choose to run the project directly in Eclipse without a web server, but for optimal testing and functionality, having a web server is recommended.

Configure your chosen web server to point to the project's root directory, typically containing an index.html file.
Run the Project:

Without web server:
Right-click on the index.html file in Eclipse and select Run As > Internal Web Browser.
With web server:
Start your web server and access the landing page through the configured URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/index.html).
